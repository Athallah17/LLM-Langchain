# Company Car Rental Database: Conversational Interface

This project utilizes Google Palm and Langchain technologies to create a conversational interface for interacting with a MySQL database dedicated to managing a company's car rental operations. The system enables users, such as rental managers, to ask questions in natural language, which are then translated into SQL queries and executed against the database.

## Example Queries:
- **"How many SUVs are available for rent this weekend?"**
- **"Show me the total revenue generated from luxury car rentals last month."**
- **"Which compact cars have mileage less than 30,000 kilometers?"**

This approach streamlines access to critical rental information, including fleet availability, financial insights, and specific vehicle details. By leveraging real-time data processing, the system enhances operational efficiency and decision-making within the car rental company.
