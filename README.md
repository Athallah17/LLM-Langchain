Company Car Rental Database: Conversational Interface

Developing an end-to-end language model project using Google Palm and Langchain technologies, enabling natural language interactions with a MySQL database for a company's car rental operations. This system allows users, such as rental managers, to ask questions in everyday language. Here are examples of queries the system can handle:

"How many rental car available today?"
"Show me the total revenue from only toyota brand."
"Which  cars have mileage less than 30,000 kilometers?"

The system intelligently converts these questions into SQL queries and executes them on the MySQL database housing information about the company's car fleet, rental transactions, and customer details. This setup enhances operational efficiency by providing quick, accurate responses based on real-time data.
